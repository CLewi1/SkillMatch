# Project Progress - SkillMatch AI

## Overview
Building an AI-powered resume analyzer that extracts skills, classifies job roles, and matches candidates to relevant job opportunities.

## Architecture Decision
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI + ML models
- **Frontend**: React with Vite + React Router
- **Database**: SQLite (development) → PostgreSQL (production)
- **ML**: Start with simple models (TF-IDF + LogisticRegression)

## Current Status
- ✅ Root folder created
- ✅ Notes folder established  
- ✅ Backend/, frontend/, ml_models/ folders created
- ✅ Comprehensive .gitignore added (Python + Node + VSCode)
- ✅ README.md updated with project description
- ✅ Git repository initialized and tracked
- ✅ **Phase 0 Complete!**
- ✅ Virtual environment created (Python 3.12.1)
- ✅ FastAPI + uvicorn + python-multipart installed
- ✅ Basic FastAPI app created and tested
- ✅ Development server working with auto-reload
- ✅ **Phase 1 Complete!**
- ✅ POST /upload endpoint created
- ✅ PDF validation and file size limits
- ✅ File saving to uploads/ directory
- ✅ Metadata response with file details
- ✅ **Phase 2 Complete!**
- ✅ SQLite database integration with SQLAlchemy ORM
- ✅ Resume model with proper relationships
- ✅ Database session lifecycle management
- ✅ File metadata persistence and tracking
- ✅ **Phase 3 Complete!**
- ✅ React frontend with professional file upload interface
- ✅ Custom drop zone with drag-and-drop functionality
- ✅ File validation and real-time status feedback
- ✅ Axios integration with FastAPI backend
- ✅ CORS configuration working in Codespaces
- ✅ End-to-end upload flow (UI → Backend → Database)
- ✅ **Phase 4 Complete!**
- ✅ React Router integration with multi-page navigation
- ✅ Mock authentication system with login/logout flows
- ✅ Protected routes with ProtectedRoute wrapper component
- ✅ Layout component with conditional navigation (Navbar)
- ✅ 7 page components with placeholder content (Landing, Login, Dashboard, Upload, Jobs, Compare, Settings)
- ✅ Client-side routing with state preservation (useNavigate vs window.location)
- ✅ Authentication-aware navigation with different nav items for authenticated/unauthenticated users
- ✅ **Phase 4.5 Complete!**
- ✅ LoginModal component created as reusable modal with Google/GitHub login UI
- ✅ State lifting implemented - modal state managed in App.tsx for global access
- ✅ Dynamic navbar navigation based on user authentication state
- ✅ Logo routing (landing page for guests, dashboard for authenticated users)
- ✅ Props passing architecture: App → Layout → Navbar for login modal control
- ✅ JobCard component structure designed for job listing displays
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns - modal UI vs authentication logic
- ✅ Navigation consistency with protected routes and user-aware redirects
- ✅ Component reusability patterns established for scalable architecture
- ✅ **Phase 4.5 Enhanced**


## Next Steps
Ready to move to **Phase 5 - Resume Text Extraction**:
1. Install PyMuPDF for PDF text extraction
2. Extract clean, structured text from uploaded resumes
3. Use spaCy for natural language processing
4. Parse resume sections (skills, education, experience)
5. Structure extracted data for AI analysis

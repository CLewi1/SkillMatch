# Phase 2 Complete - Resume Upload API ✅

Successfully built a **production-ready file upload endpoint** that validates, saves, and tracks PDF resumes.

## What We Built

### Core Functionality
- **POST /upload route** - Accepts multipart form data
- **PDF validation** - Rejects non-PDF files with clear error
- **File size limits** - 5MB maximum to prevent abuse
- **File persistence** - Saves to `uploads/` directory
- **Metadata response** - Returns filename, size, content type

### Code Implementation
```python
@app.post("/upload")
async def upload_file(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    # Validation checks
    if file.content_type != "application/pdf":
        return {"error": "Not a PDF File!"}
    if file.size > 5 * 1024 * 1024:  # 5 MB limit
        return {"error": "File too large!"}

    # Read and save file
    content = await file.read()
    file_path = os.path.join("uploads", file.filename)
    
    with open(file_path, "wb") as f:
        f.write(content)

    return {
        "file_name": file.filename,
        "size": file.size,
        "content_type": file.content_type,
        "saved_to": file_path
    }
```

## Learning Conversation - Q&A Session

### **Q: Why do we need uvicorn and python-multipart alongside FastAPI?**
**Student Answer**: Not answered initially - this was educational background.

**Complete Answer**: 
- **uvicorn**: FastAPI is a framework, not a server. It needs an ASGI server to actually serve HTTP requests. uvicorn provides the async server that runs FastAPI apps.
- **python-multipart**: FastAPI can't handle file uploads by default. When browsers send files, they use `multipart/form-data` format. This library parses that data and extracts files so FastAPI can handle them cleanly.

### **Q: Where should we save uploaded files? What folder structure makes sense?**
**Student Answer**: "I know that we are storing everything in the uploads folder."

**Complete Answer**: The `uploads/` folder in the backend directory is correct for development. Key considerations:
- Files should be outside the main code directory for security
- In production, you'd use cloud storage (AWS S3, etc.)
- Need to handle filename conflicts (same name overwrites)
- Consider organizing by date or user ID as app grows

### **Q: What do you think async def means instead of just def?**
**Student Answer**: "I think async means asynchronous which means it is always listening"

**Complete Answer**: Close! `async def` means the function can handle multiple requests concurrently without blocking. Like a restaurant server taking multiple orders without waiting for each one to complete. It's not "always listening" but rather "non-blocking execution."

### **Q: What do you think the ... means in File(...)?**
**Student Answer**: "I think the ... means to reference anything passed to it, similar to self."

**Complete Answer**: Correct concept! The `...` (Ellipsis) in `File(...)` means "this parameter is required." It's FastAPI's way of saying "you MUST upload a file to use this route." It's a dependency injection pattern.

### **Q: What information can we get from the file object?**
**Student Answer**: Through experimentation discovered: filename, content_type, size.

**Complete Answer**: Exactly right! The UploadFile object provides:
- `file.filename` - Original filename from upload
- `file.content_type` - MIME type (e.g., "application/pdf")
- `file.size` - File size in bytes
- `file.read()` - Async method to get file content

### **Q: What is the size represented as?**
**Student Answer**: Correctly identified it as bytes after seeing output of 2973.

**Complete Answer**: Perfect! File sizes are always in bytes. 2973 bytes ≈ 2.9 KB. Understanding byte measurements:
- 1 KB = 1,024 bytes (binary system)
- 1 MB = 1,024 KB = 1,048,576 bytes
- 1 GB = 1,024 MB

### **Q: How can I format the file size in the printout?**
**Student Answer**: Not directly answered - moved to explanation phase.

**Complete Answer**: Several approaches:
```python
# Simple division
f"{file.size / 1024:.1f} KB"

# Proper unit conversion function
def format_file_size(size_bytes):
    if size_bytes < 1024:
        return f"{size_bytes} bytes"
    elif size_bytes < 1024 * 1024:
        return f"{size_bytes / 1024:.1f} KB"
    # ... etc
```

### **Q: Why do we divide by 1024 instead of 1000?**
**Student Answer**: "We divide by 1024 because binary system and 1 kb is equal to 1024 not 1000."

**Complete Answer**: Exactly correct! Computers use binary (base-2), so:
- 1 KB = 2^10 = 1,024 bytes (binary)
- vs decimal where 1 kB = 1,000 bytes
- This is why storage devices show different sizes than OS

### **Q: What does .1f mean in the format string?**
**Student Answer**: ".1f means round to 1 floating point."

**Complete Answer**: Perfect! `.1f` formats to 1 decimal place (floating point). Format breakdown:
- `.1` = 1 decimal place
- `f` = fixed-point notation (float)
- Could also use `.2f` for 2 decimals, etc.

### **Q: How do we read file content, create file paths, and write files?**
**Student Answer**: "await uploadfile.read(), os.path.join is better so you don't need escape characters, open with wb mode"

**Complete Answer**: Excellent research! All three concepts correct:
- `await file.read()` - Async file reading (returns bytes)
- `os.path.join()` - Cross-platform path building (handles `/` vs `\`)
- `open(mode="wb")` - Write binary mode for saving raw file bytes

## Key Learning Points

### FastAPI File Handling
- **UploadFile**: FastAPI's wrapper for uploaded files
- **File(...)**: Dependency injection for required files
- **async/await**: Asynchronous file reading for performance
- **python-multipart**: Required dependency for form data parsing

### File System Operations
- **os.path.join()**: Cross-platform path building
- **Binary mode ("wb")**: Required for saving file bytes
- **await file.read()**: Asynchronous file content reading

### Validation Patterns
- **Content type checking**: `application/pdf` for PDFs
- **Size limits**: Prevent abuse with byte-level checks
- **Early returns**: Fast failure for invalid uploads

## Production Considerations

### Current Limitations
- **File naming conflicts**: Same filename overwrites previous
- **No persistence**: File metadata not stored in database
- **No user association**: Can't track who uploaded what
- **Limited error handling**: Basic validation only

### Security Notes
- File size limits prevent DoS attacks
- Content type validation prevents malicious uploads
- Binary write mode prevents code injection

## Testing Verification
✅ **PDF uploads**: Successfully saved to uploads/ folder
✅ **Non-PDF rejection**: PNG files properly rejected
✅ **Size validation**: Large files blocked with error message
✅ **Metadata response**: Accurate file information returned

## Ready for Phase 3
- Database integration to persist upload metadata
- SQLAlchemy models for Resume tracking
- User association (future phases)
- Upload history and management

**Foundation built**: We now have a reliable file upload system ready for AI processing pipeline.

# Project Start - SkillMatch AI

## Overview
Building an AI-powered resume analyzer that extracts skills, classifies job roles, and matches candidates to relevant job opportunities.

## Architecture Decision
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI + ML models
- **Frontend**: React with Vite
- **Database**: SQLite (development) → PostgreSQL (production)
- **ML**: Start with simple models (TF-IDF + LogisticRegression)

## Next Steps
Ready to move to **Phase 5 - Resume Text Extraction**:
1. Install PyMuPDF for PDF text extraction
2. Extract clean, structured text from uploaded resumes
3. Use spaCy for natural language processing
4. Parse resume sections (skills, education, experience)
5. Structure extracted data for AI analysis
